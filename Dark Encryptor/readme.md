### Look around

After navigating to the target web server hosted at ```http://10.10.132.71:5000```, I opened Burp Suite and enabled Intercept to capture the form submission request. Here's what I saw:

![Webapp page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01e15f07-adb3-41de-b05c-87ac0734ca7c)


```bash

### Testing for Injection

After playing around with BurpeSuite I was able to get a response with ```;ls -a``` just testing the waters, I injected another command to read any file called flag.txt

```bash
text_input=hello; cat flag.txt;&recipient=NullPhantom
```

### Response
The server responded successfully and embedded the result directly in the HTML response. Nestled in the page was a PGP message block â€” and right beneath it, a plaintext flag!
